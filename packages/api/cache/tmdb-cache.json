From the first reading around the table through the first contact with the performance space, rehearsals and lighting to opening night, the entire creative process unfurls in front of our eyes. The film shows us the evolving and ongoing dialogue between Greggory and Chéreau, a dialogue full of crises and magical moments of harmony and insight via which the truth, intensity, complexity, mystery and depth of Koltès’ text gradually emerge to form an implicit bond between these two men. The film also shows Chéreau directing rehearsals for Mozart’s \"Don Giovanni\" in Salzburg, revealing both the unity of and profound differences between his opera and theater work.","popularity":0.0573,"posterPath":null,"releaseDate":"1996-01-30","title":"Patrice Chéreau, Pascal Greggory, une autre solitude","video":false,"voteAverage":10,"voteCount":1},{"adult":false,"backdropPath":null,"genreIds":[35],"id":376748,"originalLanguage":"fr","originalTitle":"Alone Man Show","overview":"","popularity":0.0743,"posterPath":"/k9FJl8tjZRX4befTbKxQGkGECfz.jpg","releaseDate":"2011-07-11","title":"Alone Man Show","video":false,"voteAverage":4.5,"voteCount":3},{"adult":false,"backdropPath":"/f7iYcaRbP9Eog6ts9OfdQbTeWvV.jpg","genreIds":[10402],"id":674257,"originalLanguage":"fr","originalTitle":"Pascal Obispo, la 100ème","overview":"","popularity":0.0478,"posterPath":"/e9TkUlXqm3UzyR7HPgFfKzEc80w.jpg","releaseDate":"2020-02-04","title":"Pascal Obispo, la 100ème","video":false,"voteAverage":0,"voteCount":0},{"adult":false,"backdropPath":null,"genreIds":[],"id":616313,"originalLanguage":"fr","originalTitle":"Chutes de Pascal","overview":"Outtakes from the movie","popularity":0.0239,"posterPath":"/9VJyRsf7kJuob6Vun5yotQnvCIf.jpg","releaseDate":"1981-01-01","title":"Chutes de Pascal","video":false,"voteAverage":0,"voteCount":0},{"adult":false,"backdropPath":null,"genreIds":[10402],"id":265231,"originalLanguage":"fr","originalTitle":"Pascal Obispo - Les Fleurs de Forest","overview":"","popularity":0.0239,"posterPath":"/2hz5z7kLvtwoU202uIOhUCuHihf.jpg","releaseDate":"2007-06-01","title":"Pascal Obispo - Les Fleurs de Forest","video":false,"voteAverage":0,"voteCount":0},{"adult":false,"backdropPath":"/jdFF4xeDVmlsMTo1kkQsgkxXnH3.jpg","genreIds":[10402],"id":1337125,"originalLanguage":"fr","originalTitle":"Pascal Obispo : 30 ans de succès","overview":"","popularity":0.0214,"posterPath":"/mck1cIRTvKFXd3DKqVcpQ9HOd9t.jpg","releaseDate":"2024-08-21","title":"Pascal Obispo : 30 ans de succès","video":false,"voteAverage":8,"voteCount":1},{"adult":false,"backdropPath":"/31KXDuq1PoRptbmmiN3xGDClfpi.jpg","genreIds":[99],"id":1555820,"originalLanguage":"fr","originalTitle":"Conversation avec Pascal Bonitzer","overview":"In a handful of deliberately and gently dark films, screenwriter and director Pascal Bonitzer has built a body of work that is both fierce and gentle.

Chéreau, Pascal Greggory, une autre solitude","overview":"A look at the entire process of creating and developing Patrice Chéreau’s third staging of \"In the Solitude of Cotton Fields\" by Bernard Marie Koltès with Pascal Greggory and Chéreau himself. From the first reading around the table through the first contact with the performance space, rehearsals and lighting to opening night, the entire creative process unfurls in front of our eyes. The film shows us the evolving and ongoing dialogue between Greggory and Chéreau, a dialogue full of crises and magical moments of harmony and insight via which the truth, intensity, complexity, mystery and depth of Koltès’ text gradually emerge to form an implicit bond between these two men. The film also shows Chéreau directing rehearsals for Mozart’s \"Don Giovanni\" in Salzburg, revealing both the unity of and profound differences between his opera and theater work.","popularity":0.0573,"posterPath":null,"productionCompanies":[{"id":11332,"logoPath":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","originCountry":"FR"},{"id":2587,"logoPath":null,"name":"Ministère de la Culture
